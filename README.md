## Project Goals

This project was part of the Codaisseur real world project week at Codaisseur, with its goal being getting students acquainted with working for, and with productowners/non-coders. The project turned out to be a lot more for me though, as it is actually the first project I was offered payment for, and ended up getting a proper release (As the only project of our class).
